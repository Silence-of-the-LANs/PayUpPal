# PayUpPal

A progressive web app utilizing machine learning that allows users to track shared expenses and request payments. Users can upload receipts, which will then be parsed and presented to the user for edits. User can then indicate which friends to include on the expense. The user has the option to split the expense evenly, or assign friends to various items. To assign friends, users have access to a manageable friends list. In addition, users can view and track their money owed, according to receipt or by friend - whichever they prefer. To help manage their money owed, users can also send reminders to their friends. If the user ever loses a receipt, they will have access in our app via its receipt history feature.

The front-end is built using React, Material-UI, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The backend is built with Node, Express, Sequelize, PostgresSQL, and Amazon S3. For text detection, the app utilizes Google Vision API. Reminder notifications for the app are sent using Nodemailer and Twilio, and user sessions are managed with Passport.js.
